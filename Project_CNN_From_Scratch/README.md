# Project CNN from Scratch

To train and evaluate model, you can run 3 python files representing for my 3 networks
1. mnist_MLP.py   => Fully Connected Neural Network
2. mnist_CNN.py   => Simple Convolutional Neural Network (less components than Full CNN)
3. mnist_CNN.py   => Convolutional Neural Network (I added more layers than Simple CNN) 

With 3 these networks, each result of them is in folder "results", you can see not only the result in their own folder, but also see the network visualization which I drew, or you can see network visualization in my pptx file
